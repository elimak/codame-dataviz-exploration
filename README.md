Codame-dataviz-exploration


Data visualization for the Codame Event: Playground (May 2014) in San Francisco.
at this stage of the development, the viz shows a cross section of the location and the exhibits (blue pulsars) 
the moving little 'plobs' represent the people and their check-ins (room or exhibits)

The data used for now was generated for dev purpose, but the final data will be coming from the ios app of the attendees

The viz is developed using createjs and its extension to support webgl implementation
